The attempt to run this simulation that would indicate whether the ability of Machina to infer migrations scaled with sample size was a failure overall and the results are not very interpretable above sample size 500. This is because Machina needs hours to resolve above a 500 sample size and I had to ultimately attempt the simulations with a reasonable 30 min cutof that led to an output file with almost no information except for inferring low or no migrations which would be simple for Machina to resolve in 30 min at higher sample sizes.
